## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in the manufacturing and distribution of computers and peripherals, has experienced rapid growth across various countries. Traditionally, the company relied on Excel files for data analytics. However, this approach proved inadequate for generating actionable insights, leading to significant losses, notably in the Latin American market. Recognizing the need for a more robust analytics solution, senior executives initiated the Business Insights 360 project to implement a comprehensive Power BI dashboard.

To outshine competitors, they've adopted Power BI for analytics with 1.8 million transaction records from Excel, CSV, and MySQL. The Power BI Dashboard includes:
- Home Page: Central navigation for Dashboard.
- Finance: Develop a Profit and Loss statement to evaluate financial performance across different markets, products, and customer segments.
- Sales: Identify top and bottom-performing customers, along with key sales metrics, to enhance customer relationship management.
- Marketing: Analyze product performance metrics to inform marketing strategies and product development.
- Supply Chain: Assess supply chain efficiency through KPIs such as forecast accuracy, net error, and absolute error.
- Executive: Provide an integrated dashboard offering key insights for top-level management people to have effective decision-making.
- Product: Stakeholder's request to view overall market top 5 & bottom 5 products based on GM% Growth YoY and the post discounts % trend for each customer.
